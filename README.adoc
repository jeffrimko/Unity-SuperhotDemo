= Unity Superhot Demo

This is a simple demo of implementing the https://superhotgame.com/[Superhot] time/movement mechanics in https://unity3d.com[Unity].

In this demo, there is a single scene where the player (blue guy) is being chased by two enemies (red guys). There is also a rain like effect because it looks cool with the time mechanic.

Here is what the scene looks like in action:
